# <a name="technology"> Technologies Used </a>

#### <a name="style"> HTML CSS BootStrap</a>

Upon loading our site, the user will see several items displayed on the screen. 

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5eFuAex1xZ8LwelHJc/giphy.gif">

1) A background video of waves coming ashore.
2) A gray navigation bar at the top of the webpage displaying Inspector Otter's Logo to the left and a word search bar to the right with a yellow submit button. 
3) A search area to the left where users can input their location and find cafes near the location that was input (as people who search word definitions may be new to the area). 
4) An area where previously search words are displayed for the user to see. 
5) A dark-blue colored footer with a white <img src ="assets/images/about.png" height= "25px"> button. 

Upon clicking the <img src ="assets/images/search.png" height= "25px"> button for a search word within the navigation bar, the user will be shown the **Merriam-Webster** definition of the word, along with several **new** buttons. The four new buttons that appear when a user searches a word are <img src ="assets/images/foreignbuttons.png" height= "25px"> and <img src ="assets/images/unofficialbutton.png" height= "25px">. 

When any one of the Spanish, Chinese, or Russian buttons are clicked, the searched word's **translation** will be displayed. When the unofficial definition button is clicked, the **Urban Dictionary** definition of the word searched is displayed. See demo below when a user submits a word into the search bar and clicks on the Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Unofficial Definition buttons.

When a user inputs a location into the search bar of the cafe search function, images and other information regarding local cafes will be  displayed for user convenience.

In terms of styling the webpage, we used <a name="bootstrap">BootStrap</a> to display the Navigation Bar, Footer, Buttons, a pop-up about page, and to make our website responsive. We also used our own CSS style sheet to change colors, fonts, positioning. Additionally we used the Inconsolata font from <a name="google"> Google Fonts</a> to display our text.

#### <a name="jumble">Jumble</a>

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ieebglCGDJJa6Q06tY/giphy.gif">

Jumble is a jQuery plugin that jumbles up the colors of your text headers, and can also be animated. We used this plugin to bring more color to our webpage. You can see the Jumble effect being used on the names of the authors in the About section of the website.

More information regarding Jumble can be found at: https://github.com/vonKristoff/jumble

#### <a name="bideo">Bideo.js</a>

Bideo.js is a JavaScript plugin used to play a video in the background of a container/body. For our webpage we decided to feature a video of a string of waves crashing onto the beach for aesthetic purposes.

More information regarding Bideo.js can be found at: https://github.com/rishabhp/bideo.js 


#### <a name="java">JavaScript & jQuery</a>
The majority of our HTML webpage is being dynamically generated through our JavaScript file using the jQuery library. Our JavaScript is organized by section, seperating the APIs we used in this project by section. 

#### <a name="firebase">Firebase</a>
We are using firebase to store the the user-inputted word. The database is then being called upon to display words that have been searched under the _previous word searches_ section of our webpage. We are also setting a counter to display the number of words which have been searched and stored in firebase.  

#### <a name="ajax">API Technologies</a>
Our team uses several APIs for our Inspector Otter Webpage. 
1) We are using Webster Dictionary API to retrieve the formal definitions of the word the user searches. https://www.merriam-webster.com/ 
2) We use Urban Dictionary API to retrieve the informal/slang word definitions the user can view upon clicking on the unofficial definition button. https://www.urbandictionary.com/
3) We incorporate Google Translate into our website through the Spanish, Chinese and Russian buttons. When a user clicks on one of these buttons, the translated word appears in the selected foreign language. https://cloud.google.com/translate/
4) In addition we are using Zomato api which allows us to pull information related to restaurants near a location the user inputs. The idea is to recommend cafes for the user to check out since our target group are new people to the area. https://www.zomato.com/
5) We applied https://www.giphy.com to the webpage by pulling the user input and showing a gif regarding its vibe/essence

# <a name="otter">About Inspector Otter</a>

Inspector Otter has made it his **life mission** to help **EVERYONE** understand what in the world people around you are saying. In addition to chirping, purring, squealing, and gurgling, Mr. Otter is an avid English speaker with over 10+ years of experience studying and sharing word definitions, and translations with those who seek his knowledge. 

In this day and age of advanced technology and ever-changing trends, if you find yourself struggling to understand a word you hear, why torture yourself and put yourself through the agonizing pain and struggle of researching that word, only to discover upon completion that the word has already become obsolete. Inspector Otter can complete research for you with a fraction of the time and effort! Best of all, he will do it for **FREE**! You might be asking yourself, "Free!? What's the catch?". Well today's your lucky day as there is no catch. Inspector Otter prides himself on doing all the heavy lifting for *YOU* so you can get back to **your life**! Why is Inspector Otter so generous and why does he do it for free you ask? Well, his philanthropic ways stems from an incident which occurred many moons ago.

Previously a Pop Mogul, Inspector Otter left his lavish lifestyle behind him shortly after witnessing an argument between two of his neighbors, Mr. Badger and Ms. Wolverine. One day, Inspector Otter decided to head out to his backyard and enjoy a couple of margaritas on his back porch. Upon entering his backyard, Inspector Otter notices Ms. Wolverine giving Mr. Badger a hand with some basic yard work. Upon completing various tasks such as picking apples, raking leaves, and mowing the lawn, Ms. Wolverine proceeds to exclaim "That was a piece of cake!". Unbeknownst to Mr. Badger, he thought Ms. Wolverine said something along the lines of **_you're_ a piece of cake**.

As Mr. Badger had been making extra effort to lose the extra 15 pounds he gained last winter, he took offense to her comments and scurried away into his burrow. 
Inspector Otter was casually eavesdropping on his neighbors' conversation and quickly recognized that the miscommunication was due to Ms. Wolverine's strong accent, which made it hard for Mr. Badger to understand. As Inspector Otter was comforting Mr. Badger from the stressful ordeal, he explained that the phrase "*piece of cake*", when Ms. Wolverine used it, meant that the yard work was simple to accomplish. Upon hearing Otter's explanation, Mr. Badger was red, filled with embarrassment and hurried over to Ms. Wolverine to apologize for his abrupt exit and for the misunderstanding. 

Inspector Otter recognizes that miscommunications happen everyday and hopes that he, through his hard work, can change lives for the better and ensure that people like you and I will never have to struggle to understand words that are being used, and to never find themselves in an embarrassing situation similar to that of Mr. Badger.
